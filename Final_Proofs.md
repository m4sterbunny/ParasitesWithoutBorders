This is just for assigning out final proof issues


NB BIOS ARE NOT EDITED YET




2. Variants in terms

following D&D read through the term antihelminthic (and its variant anthelminthic) has been moved to antihelmintic - I am trying to apply this across the text. Search for any remnants of the other 2 variants.


3. Last read through needs to check for paragraphs tied together without spacing- still finding this whilst applying D&D edits

4. also check for overset text- still finding this when there is plenty of space in references

5.a and b) Have the chapter changes reflected in the table of contents? e.g. 34. Clonorchis sinensis and Opisthorchis spp. was 34. Clonorchis sinensis AND have the reflected at top of page for chapters?

6. Are table headers consistent - e.g. in insects table number is bold and name, regular

7. Are headings consistent- late change to bold NOT italicised

8. Table of contents has ref to historical figures- I think we no longer have these in one section - rather throughout book.

9. Check 3.3 refs match version 12 iD refs

10. Verify all symbols survive index transfer e.g. TNF-aplpha, interferon-gamma
