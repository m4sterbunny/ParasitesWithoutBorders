1. Use of ' and the curly version of that (!)
2. Inconsistent application of Genus species, then at subsequent mention of Genus G. rather than full Genus newspecies (G. newspecies).
3. D&D round for edition 7 saw suggestions for - alternations, these were not applied. The issue needs to be clarified and applied at edition 8
