# Parasitic Diseases Writing Style Guide

*To edit any styles in this document use* "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request" (PR) at the bottom of the page. Name the PR with a description of the desired edit. 

## 1. General points of style

The general style follows the [Journal of Parasitology](https://www.journalofparasitology.org/doi/pdf/10.1645/18-93) with variations.

a) Use the times new roman (12 pt) throughout the manuscript; Arial 9 for figures; tables can be adjusted as appropriate. References times new roman 10.

b) Words and abbreviations in Latin and other non-English languages are italicized. (deviates from Journal of Parasitology) e.g.  *colpitis macularis*, *in vitro*

c) refer to images directly e.g., (Fig 3) - not (see Fig x) 

d) when the fig is referred to by a statement in parenthesis it is joined with a colon e.g. (such as the boodstream trypanomastigote; Fig 6.3), not (boodstream trypanomastigote) (Fig 6.3)

e) For initials collapse to no space e.g. C.S. Swaminath 

f) U.S. spelling and convention variants applied i.e., (comma) (id est, which means that is)
e.g., (comma) exempli gratia, which means for the sake of example

## 2. Acronyms and Abbreviations

a) Standard terms may be applied in the text with no definition e.g. DNA
b) Abbreviations are defined at first use in a chapter (even if usage is singular). At first use, acronyms are placed in parentheses following the name written out in full. At subsequent use, the acronym alone is used. 
c) Abbreviations such as mo, yr, wk are used when a number is present. Otherwise they are spelled out in full (e.g., (e.g., ‘‘10-yrold,’’ ‘‘6 wk’’ but ‘‘odd years,’’ ‘‘once each week’’).
d) no double periods e.g. "sp.", “spp..” (at end of sentence) (NB spp not italicized)
e) Names of months are written out in the text, but may be abbreviated in tables and figures. When abbreviating months, use the first 3 letters of the month but omit a trailing period. Be consistent (i.e., in a table or figure, abbreviate no month or abbreviate all months).

## 3. Headings

a) Heading- do not use acronym or standard terms shorts in a heading .
e.g. Species not spp.
e.g. Visceral Leishmaniasis not VL.
Standard terms are allowed e.g. DNA.
c) Chapter heading, is numbered for chapter, bold, 14 point.
d) Sub heading 1 and 2 is bold, 14 point.
e) Headings are capitilized except for term/s before the common noun e.g., Epidemiology of Flea-Borne Diseases or species e.g., *Giardia lamblia*.
f) Italics in headings are only for Genus or Species (see Scientific Names).

## 4. Pronunciations

In multi-parasite chapters pronunciation follows each name at first use: *Trypanosoma brucei gambiense* (\tri-PAN-oh-so-mah\\BROOS-ee-eye\\gam-BEE-en-see\).

## 5. Terms with common variants

a) vector-borne (hyphen)
b( Kala-azar (hyphen)
c) down-regulate (hyphen)
d) gall-bladder
e) worldwide 
f) extraintestinal 
g) coinfected
h) life cycle (2 words)
i) antihelmintic (not antihelminthics or anthelminthic)
j) Specialized cells may have capital for common noun- e.g., Mott cell and Nurse cell


## 6. Scientific Names 

NB *"typography is a matter of editorial style and tradition not of nomenclature."*
– "Preface", The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN), 2011

a) Scientific binomens (Genus species) must be included for all hosts and parasites mentioned. Where possible, provide the common name of each host species on first mention. 

b) Italics are used for taxa at the level of genus and below. All bacterial and viral genes are italicized. 

e.g. Humans, *Homo sapiens*, belong to phylum Chordata, class Mammalia, and family Hominidae. 

Additional references supporting this convention are [da Silva}(https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/pbj.2016.61.issue-1/pbj-2016-0014/pbj-2016-0014.pdf)
[INTERNATIONAL CODE OF ZOOLOGICAL NOMENCLATURE](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?nfv=true&booksection=appendixB)

c) The genus name (and above) is always capitalized, the species name is never capitalized

d) The full binomen is written out at the first use of a species name in the abstract, text, figure legends and tables, even if it
is part of a series of species in the same genus. Thereafter, the genus is abbreviated by use of the first letter, except at the
beginning of a sentence where it is written out; and, in any situation where abbreviations would cause confusion 2-letter
abbreviations may be used (e.g., ‘‘*Schistosoma mansoni* and *Schistosoma japonicum*’’ on first usage; subsequently, ‘‘*S.
mansoni* and *S. japonicum*’’ but ‘‘*Aedes aegypti* and *Anopheles gambiae*’’ on first usage; subsequently ‘‘*Ae. aegypti* and *An.
gambiae*’’).

e) Author and date citations for scientific names in brackets following chapter heading only. 
e.g. *Giardia lamblia* (Stiles 1915) 

f) Authors are reminded that names of taxa are not names of organisms. For example, *Fasciola* is the name of a genus (a
group of related species) and as such it does not lay eggs, ingest cells, possess a sucker, etc. These are properties of
organisms. Genus and species names should not be used as adjectives (e.g., not ‘‘*Schistosoma* cercariae’’ but ‘‘schistosome cercariae’’) or as plurals (e.g., not ‘‘some *Brucella melitensis*’’ but ‘‘specimens of *Brucella melitensis*’’).
‘‘Specimens’’ or ‘‘individuals’’ are plural and can take action: a genus or species cannot take action and is never plural.

Abbreviations or symbols denoting nucleic acid products or
sequences (i.e., genes, alleles, mRNAs) are italicized; abbreviations or symbols denoting amino acid products or
sequences (proteins) are roman type.

g) All genes are referenced in accordance with the guidelines for [Human Gene Nomenclature HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee](www.genenames.org/about/guidelines).

## 7. Numbers
a) Numerals do not begin a sentence.
b) otherwise use Arabic numerals throughout, except in common phrases (e.g., "one of us" but "1,000 microbes on the head of 1 pin"). Naked decimals are not permitted in the text, tables, legends, or on figures (i.e., ‘0.1’ not ‘.1’). Numbers greater than 999 must have commas (except in Literature Cited). Metric units are to be used in all articles. The 24-hour system is used to indicate time (e.g., 15:00 hr).
c) Degree symbols are used with temperatures, latitude/longitude and angles (deviates from Journal of Parasitology) e.g. 20 °C
d) Use a space between measurements and number e.g. "25 mm", "2 g"
e) No space between % and numerals (e.g., 25%).
f) Ranges are separated by an[En-dash](https://www.thepunctuationguide.com/en-dash.html) e.g., 15–40 µm
g) Numbered lists sit within the text (with the exception of the Appendices) e.g., - 4. with continual flow to sentence

## 8. Places
a)  Country names should be spelled in English (e.g., ‘‘Ivory Coast’’ not ‘‘Cote d’Ivoire’’). Names of localities, states, ˆ
provinces etc. may be anglicized or written in the local language (e.g., ‘‘Lake Baikal’’ or ‘‘Ozero Baykal’’).
b) Unless stated otherwise, U.S. for United States of America (NB Journal of Parasitology has this directive: U.S.A. (as a noun)
U.S. (as an adjective)).


## 9. Citations

a) Citations are referred to by number linking to footnote
