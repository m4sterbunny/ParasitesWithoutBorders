3 Files are used to create the index base terms


The programme is producing an index that:
1) needs names to be selected for output as last name, first name
2) does not cope with de, von, van - and these names need to be edited by hand.
3) produces duplicates

Bianca has done us some python to remove the duplicates - it runs in the collab tool on gDrive
This creates a csv - grab the data from this and put in notepad/sublime for use in inDesign.
