2 Files are used to create the index base terms (basewords and names)


The programme is producing an index that:
1) needs names to be selected for output as last name, first name
2) does not cope with de, von, van - and these names need to be edited by hand.
3) produces duplicate page ranges

Bianca has done us some python to remove the duplicates - it runs in the collab tool on gDrive
This creates a csv- open this with google sheets, remove all non-index columns and download!
