notes: PDF index generator has a user interface that allows a great deal of functionality, however, there are some techniques that are quicker if they are done in 'code'. This is a mixed-methods approach, using both the interface and uploading files.

# PDF index Generator How To

## Getting the settings right

### Advanced Page Numbers

Step 1 allows the pdf to be selected and has the Advanced Page Numbers option:

This advanced page numbers option allows the removal of text or editing of the Roman numerals by hand:

For Edition 7 the decision was to index all pages

### Choosing the words to include

Step 2 allows one to select which words and terms to index. The approach we have taken is to create 3 files:

Base terms and variants (e.g. Giardia lamblia is the base term and the variant G. lamblia is merged with that).
Headings and Subheadings
Names

The decision tree for this is handled in a different how to.

This step requires that we use the include words option:

The UI is intuitive > pencil option allows you to upload your list (categories/queries). NB the software is a little buggy in that if the process has already been driven once you may need to re-upload a list to be able to proceed.

For Edition 7 we did not take the plural words option, relying instead on the word list to include all relevant plurals and with the issue that plurals of scientific terms are often not the simple addition of an s. It would be interesting to run both and see how the outcomes differ.

#### Choosing the settings 

There are 2 paths to this option, choose "Generate Index Settings" from step 2 or adjust settings from Tools at any stage.

* Disable ignore case sensitivity (case sentitivity has been handled in the include words e.g. variants Bee and bee are already included)
* Group consecutive page numbers
