purpose: how to use the software

notes: PDF index generator has a user interface that allows a great deal of functionality, however, there are some techniques that are    quicker if they are done in 'code'. This is a mixed-methods approach, using both the interface and uploading files.

The approach taken was to break all the required index terms into 3 groups

### Group 1

The base terms and all their variants, e.g., Bee is a base term and the variants bee and bees are included using syntax like so:

Bee + bee + bees = Bee

### Group 2

Terms associated with headers e.g., the Genus Giardia:

Giardia was used as a heading term and Giardia lamblis as a sub heading 

With the 2 queries (group 1 + group 2) working together this should give:

Giardia
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giardia lamblis + G. lamblis = Giardia lamblis
  
  
### Group 3 

The names are a separate group so that in post processsing they can be given format last name, first name
